- When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class,
you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes
as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the
passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

Answer:
Should the object given not be a Media instance, the equals() method will return false. Because Book, CompactDisc, and DigitalVideoDisc are subclasses of Media, the objects book, cd, and dvd are also considered as Media instances. 
A ClassCastException could occur during runtime if this is not properly handled, which could potentially lead to your program crashing.
